Reminder : I've seen several reports of errors in DataStore_Crafts, that manifest while making a search, or when a tooltip gets stuck at a vendor.
You might also get a Lua error that looks like this :

=> bad argument #2 to 'strsplit' (string expected, got table)

Related Curse Issues : 1182, 1253, 1256

This is caused by Saved Variables that have not been cleared after upgrading from Classic to TBC.
This is a MANDATORY step, and it must happen WHEN THE GAME IS NOT RUNNING !!
This means cleaning the following files in \WTF\Account\<your_account>\SavedVariables : Altoholic.lua & All DataStore*.lua
